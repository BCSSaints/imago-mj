# Testing AI Integration - Before vs After

## Current State (Without OpenAI API Key)

### Sample Question: "Can you help me with algebra homework?"

**Current Response (Fallback):**
> "I'd be happy to help with your studies! Remember that God has given us minds to learn and grow. Let's work through this together step by step. What specific part would you like help with?"

## Expected After OpenAI Integration

### Same Question: "Can you help me with algebra homework?"

**Expected AI Response:**
> "Absolutely! I'd love to help you with algebra. Mathematics is one of the beautiful ways we see God's order and logic in creation. Algebra helps us solve problems systematically, which reflects how God wants us to approach challenges in life with wisdom and patience.
> 
> What specific algebra topic are you working on? Is it:
> - Solving linear equations
> - Working with polynomials  
> - Graphing functions
> - Word problems
> 
> Once you tell me the specific problem or concept, I can walk you through it step by step, helping you understand not just the 'how' but the 'why' behind each step. Remember, Proverbs 27:17 says 'As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another' - we're going to sharpen your math skills together!"
