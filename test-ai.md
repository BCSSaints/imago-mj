# Testing OpenAI Integration

## After adding your API key, test with these steps:

### 1. Production Test
- Visit: https://e0ffa1a2.teen-ai-platform.pages.dev
- Create a demo account or use: demo@teenai.com
- Start a conversation
- Ask: "Can you help me with math homework?"
- **Expected**: Rich, contextual AI response instead of basic fallback

### 2. Local Development Test
- Update `.dev.vars` with your API key
- Restart the local server: `pm2 restart teen-ai-platform`
- Test the same conversation locally

## What Changes After Adding API Key:

### Before (Fallback Responses):
- Simple, pre-written responses
- Limited contextual understanding
- Basic safety responses

### After (Real AI):
- Rich, theological AI responses
- Contextual conversation memory
- Advanced content analysis
- Personalized tutoring based on custom GPT settings
- Natural, encouraging biblical wisdom integration

## Cost Considerations:
- GPT-4 costs ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (about $0.06 per conversation)
- For family use: Approximately $5-20/month depending on usage
- Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard if desired
