## 🎯 **Expected AI Response Example**

After creating your AI assistant, when a teen asks:
*"Can you help me understand algebra?"*

**Expected Response:**
> "Absolutely! I'd love to help you with algebra. You know, mathematics is one of the most beautiful reflections of God's perfect order and design in creation. When we solve algebraic equations, we're discovering the logical relationships that God built into the very fabric of reality.
> 
> In algebra, every problem has a solution - just like how God promises that when we seek wisdom, we will find it (Proverbs 2:6). The systematic way we work through equations teaches us patience and perseverance, which are fruits of the Spirit.
> 
> What specific algebra concept are you working on? Linear equations? Quadratic formulas? I'm here to walk through it step by step with you!"
